    <h2>About Me!</h2>
    <p>Hey there! I'm Diyah Sreekumar,  a thirteen year old high-schooler. I've had a great life so far. Coding was a major part of it. I love it! I love drawing, painting, singing, acting and of course coding. If watching anime, sleeping and eating were hobbies then I'd have mentioned them too. I'm from Kerala- a small state in India. I hope you'll like to know more about me! </p>
